## Built on MazeExplorer
New File: createWad.py
Check textMap1.txt for text representation of the map.

### Goal:
Create a textual representation of a room in Doom and change it to a .wad file. 

### Algorithm to improve on map:
Create a basic maze and have the next map improve based on complexity of previous maps.
